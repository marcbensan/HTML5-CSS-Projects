        <h2>What are Tarantulas?</h2>
        <p>Tarantulas are species of spiders that have the characteristics of being large, hairy, and scary. They belong to the family Theraphosidae. Tarantulas consists of 1040 different species with 156 different genres. Tarantulas are often misunderstood due to media portraying them as terrifying and something that invokes danger. This is heavily misconstrued because even though tarantulas can inject venom, none of them pose a deadly threat to humans.</p>
        <h2>Are Tarantulas deadly?</h2>
        <p>Tarantulas are defensive species, not aggressive. This is an important concept to understand because they do not actively go out of their way to hunt or hurt humans. Most tarantula accidents happen when a tarantula has no other choice but to bite. Most of the case, they choose to retreat to safety. They run and hide or throw out a threat posture to warn potential predators from going near them. They only utilize their venomous fangs as a last resort when cornered. </p>

        <h2>Types of Tarantulas</h2>
        <p>A tarantula's venom potency depends on their genus location. There are two different kinds of tarantulas, new worlds, and old worlds. </p>

        <p>There are plenty of differences between the two such as urticating hairs, and venom potency. New world species tend to reside in the western hemisphere often found in America, and the rainforests. New world species possess the attributes of having urticating hairs and low-potency venom. To compensate for having a weaker venom, they utilize their urticating hairs as their main form of self-defense. When in danger, they would kick these hundreds of barbed wire-like hairs to irritate the aggressor/s skin, eyes, or nose. These urticating hairs can cause human skin irritation and itchiness that could last for hours. New world species also tend to have a calmer and more relaxed attitude contrary to old worlds. On the other hand, old worlds tend to be much quicker and possess highly toxic venom as their main source of self-defense. Due to lacking the ability to possess urticating hairs, they tend to solely rely on their bites which is why their venom is much more potent compared to their counterpart.</p>
        <p>Their venom can cause:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muscle soreness</li>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Dizziness</li>
            <li>Swelling</li>
            <li>Allergic Reaction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, there have been no recorded deaths caused by tarantula bites. </p>
