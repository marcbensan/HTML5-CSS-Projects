        <h2>What are Tarantulas?</h2>
        <p>Tarantulas are species of spiders that have the characteristics of being large, hairy, and scary. They belong to the family Theraphosidae. Tarantulas consists of 1040 different species with 156 different genres. Tarantulas are often misunderstood due to media portraying them as terrifying and something that invokes danger. This is heavily misconstrued because even though tarantulas can inject venom, none of them pose a deadly threat to humans.</p>
        <h2>Are Tarantulas deadly?</h2>
        <p>Tarantulas are defensive species, not aggressive. This is an important concept to understand because they do not actively go out of their way to hunt or hurt humans. Most tarantula accidents happen when a tarantula has no other choice but to bite. Most of the case, they choose to retreat to safety. They run and hide or throw out a threat posture to warn potential predators from going near them. They only utilize their venomous fangs as a last resort when cornered. </p>

        <h2>Types of Tarantulas</h2>
        <p>A tarantula's venom potency depends on their genus location. There are two different kinds of tarantulas, new worlds, and old worlds. </p>

            <h3>New world Tarantula</h3>

        <p>There are plenty of differences between the two such as urticating hairs, and venom potency. New world species tend to reside in the western hemisphere often found in America, and the rainforests. New world species possess the attributes of having urticating hairs and low-potency venom. To compensate for having a weaker venom, they utilize their urticating hairs as their main form of self-defense. When in danger, they would kick these hundreds of barbed wire-like hairs to irritate the aggressor/s skin, eyes, or nose. These urticating hairs can cause human skin irritation and itchiness that could last for hours. New world species also tend to have a calmer and more relaxed attitude contrary to old worlds. On the other hand, old worlds tend to be much quicker and possess highly toxic venom as their main source of self-defense. Due to lacking the ability to possess urticating hairs, they tend to solely rely on their bites which is why their venom is much more potent compared to their counterpart.</p>
        <p>Their venom can cause:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muscle soreness</li>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Dizziness</li>
            <li>Swelling</li>
            <li>Allergic Reaction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, there have been no recorded deaths caused by tarantula bites. </p>

        <h2>Tarantula Classification</h2>
        <p>Another classification of tarantulas is arboreal and terrestrial.  Arboreal tarantulas reside on branches and tree cervices preferring to live in a vertical environment. Terrestrial tarantulas burrow underground deserts or forest floors.</p>

            <h3>Arboreal Tarantula</h3>

        <p>Unlike other animals, tarantulas do not have obvious sexual dimorphism. The way to differentiate a male from a female is often evident when they become fully developed adults. Females can live up to 20 – 30 years while males only have an approximate 5 years of lifespan. Females also tend to get larger and bulkier than the male counterpart.</p>
        <h3>Male</h3>

        <h3>Female</h3>

        <p>When a male tarantula matures, they will develop hook-like body parts on their front hind legs. This is to prevent the female from eating the male during reproduction. They would use these pairs of legs with hooks to hold the female’s fangs still while they proceed with the reproduction process. Since tarantulas are territorial species, the females tend to eat the males most of the time during reproduction.  If the process is successful, the female can lay up to hundreds of eggs to sustain their species longevity.</p>
